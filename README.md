This Program uses Keras Running on top of TensorFlow to perform all of the standard types of operations associated with building a Convolutional Neural Network.
Image Convolution and Pooling, Flattening , Fully connected layer, activation function.

The number of step per epochs equate to number of Images in test set(8000) divided by the generator batch size(32)
which is why the steps per epoch = 250
